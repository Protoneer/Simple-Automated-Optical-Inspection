Minimum Viable Product 

## Stage 1
*	No image recognition. 
*	Board to be inspected will always be mounted at a fixed position.
* Job file with list of pre-saved coordinates.
*	Run the job, letting the machine take photo's of each position in the list. 
* After the photo shoot check the photos and list incorrect items for marking.

## Later Stage Ideas
* Use fids to align panel and for sub-panels.
* Use hardware position file to centre on components.
* Computer vision
